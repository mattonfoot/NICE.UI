      <p class="lead">NICE's role is to improve outcomes for people using the NHS and other public health and social care services. We do this by:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Producing</strong> evidence based guidance and advice for health, public health and social care practitioners.</li>
        <li><strong>Developing</strong> quality standards and performance metrics for those providing and commissioning health, public health and social care services.</li>
        <li><strong>Providing</strong> a range of informational services for commissioners, practitioners and managers across the spectrum of health and social care.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Evidence-based guidance and advice</h2>

      <p>Since 1999, we have provided the NHS, and those who rely on it for their care, with an increasing range of advice on effective, good value healthcare, and have gained a reputation for rigor, independence and objectivity. In April 2013 we gained new responsibilities for providing guidance for those working in social care.</p>
