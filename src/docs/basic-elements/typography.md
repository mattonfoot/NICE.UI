## Vertical Rhythm

In the absence of visual elements — arguably the case for many of NICE products — establishing foundations for typography underpins the content we output. This guide is designed to address [vertical rhythm](http://webtypography.net/2.2.2) and [hierarchy](http://webtypography.net/3.1.1), and can be used to promote consistency of type.

### Establishing a baseline

The NICE UI library uses a baseline grid of <code>24px</code> (a common browser default).  With this measurement we can establish a predictable and robust vertical rhythm which should dictate line heights, define hierarchy and add consistent spacing between elements.

## Fonts

The NICE UI library uses [Lato regular, bold and their respective italics](http://www.latofonts.com/lato-free-fonts/) as the standard weights. Lighter weights are also available, but are less readable on screen, particularly for Windows users so these weights are not used.

<div class="guide-example example-processed">
  <p>Nullam quis risus eget <strong>urna mollis ornare</strong> vel eu leo. Cum sociis natoque <em>penatibus et magnis</em> dis parturient montes, nascetur ridiculus mus.</p>
  <p>Cum sociis natoque <strong><em>penatibus et magnis</em></strong> dis parturient montes, nascetur ridiculus mus.</p>
</div>

### Information hierarchy through typographic scaling

Scale should be used to establish a clear and contrasting information hierarchy. To balance density of content and reading comfort, these are the optimal type sizes and styles that — along with the baseline grid — work well together for screen use.

<div class="guide-example guide-example-tight example-processed">
  <h1>h1. Bootstrap heading</h1>
  <h2>h2. Bootstrap heading</h2>
  <h3>h3. Bootstrap heading</h3>
  <h4>h4. Bootstrap heading</h4>
</div>
