Because we use third party tracking and analysis tools to help understand what needs our users have, we have to explain to our visitors that they will be tracked anonymously through the use of cookies.

[You can read the full E-Privacy policy here](http://www.nice.org.uk/cookies).

<div class="notice notice-important">
  <p><strong>Important</strong> Please ensure that your service conforms to the NICE E-Privacy policy and notify the appropriate department if it does not.</p>

## Including the E-Privacy banner

The NICE UI library provides a standard E-Privacy banner component that must be included on all
web pages to ensure compliance across services. Below is an example of the basic E-Privacy banner.

<div class="guide-example example-processed">
<div style="display:block;font-family:Lato,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;background:#ddeef4;border:1px solid #cddee4;color:#11779b;" id="cookiePolicy"><div style="display:block;margin:0 auto;width:95.74468085%;max-width:1170px;padding:12px 36px 12px 0;padding:1.2rem 3.6rem 1.2rem 0"><button style="float:right;margin:0 -36px 0 0;margin:0 -3.6rem 0 0;padding:0 1em;line-height:24px;line-height:2.4rem;background:none;border:0;color:#000;cursor:pointer;" onclick="return false;">Ã—</button>NICE uses cookies to make the site better. <a href="http://www.nice.org.uk/cookies" target="_blank" style="font-weight:700;color:inherit">Learn more</a></div></div>
</div>

To include the component you need to include the following script tag after all
other script tags in your HTML5 document <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>.

<pre class="prettyprint linenums"><code>&lt;!-- e-privacy policy script --&gt;
&lt;script src="https://cdn.nice.org.uk/v4.0.0/scripts/ui.eprivacy-policy.js" async defer&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>

## Data Storage

The [e-Privacy Directive](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:31995L0046&from=en) was updated in 2012 but still requires that website inform users in an obvious way that data is being stored regarding their online activity within a website - [See the ICO for a summary of this directive](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-pecr/cookies/). THis extends beyond cookies to the information that we store on our server or in local storage regarding a users activity.

Items exempt from this directive are items of data regarding personal user settings, or a users authenticated status. It is acceptable to presume that a user that creates an account to access further, enriched or customised content is happy to allow data tracking within the current website.

## Standard storage keys

If you are creating a new service or updating an existing service please refer to the following table for standard storage keys for specific types of information.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>key</th><th>type</th>
      <th>usage</th>
