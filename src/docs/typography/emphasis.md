### <code>&lt;small&gt;</code>

For de-emphasizing inline or blocks of text, <small>use the small tag.</small>

<div class="guide-example">
  <p><small>This line of text is meant to be treated as fine print.</small></p>
</div>

### <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code>

For emphasizing a snippet of text with a heavier font-weight.

<div class="guide-example">
  <p>The following snippet of text is <strong>rendered as bold text</strong>.</p>
</div>

### <code>&lt;em&gt;</code>

For emphasizing a snippet of text with italics.

<div class="guide-example">
  <p>The following snippet of text is <em>rendered as italicised text</em>.</p>
</div>

<div class="alert alert-info alert-block">
  <h4>Feel free to also use <code>&lt;b&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;i&gt;</code></h4>

  <p>In HTML5 <code>&lt;b&gt;</code> is meant to highlight words or phrases without conveying additional importance while <code>&lt;i&gt;</code> is mostly for voice, technical terms, etc.</p>
</div>
