By applying the <code>.ellipsis</code> class to an element you set its
**default height** to **2** lines and set the text block to display an
ellipsis symbol if the content is larger than the elements content box.

<div class="guide-example">
<p class="ellipsis example-tldr" style="width: 200px">This content should be long enough to be concatenated and have the ellipsis symbol appended to it so that it indicates that there is more.</p>
</div>
